# php-backup-mysql

PHP Script to backup MySQL databases when you only have FTP access.

This script is a life saver when I don't have SSH or direct MySQL access. Also when there's no phpMyAdmin installed or available.

### Usage

Change the DB details, the backup folder and choose the databases you want to backup.

Then just upload the file to web-serving folder through FTP and create the backup dir (remember to give permissions).

Access the URL and wait for the magic to happen.

Remember to delete the file after the backup is complete to prevent abuse or accidents.

### TODO

Provide examples to explain usage.
